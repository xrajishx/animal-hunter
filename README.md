# animal-hunter

This is a mini game built on [Godot 3.1.1](https://godotengine.org/). This game was originally made as a submission for [Linux Game Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/linux-game-jam-2019). This is my first ever game jam submission and first ever game I developed. I only created this for fun and to learn Godot; I will not be updating this project anymore.

You can find it on [itch.io](https://xrajishx.itch.io/animal-hunter).
